# Base Controller Example

## New Relic Agent Spring controller annotation instrumentation

The instrumentation assumes that Spring controllers are annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
The class can optionally be annotated with `@RequestMapping` and that path will be used at root of all other
URIs.  The methods that define mappings are annotated with `@RequestMapping` or HTTP method appropriate annotations.

Main class for contemporary
[Spring Controller Instrumentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/blob/main/instrumentation/spring-4.3.0/src/main/java/com/nr/agent/instrumentation/SpringController_Instrumentation.java)

## Build Run Test Example

Adjust `run.sh` to reflect your New Relic JAR/config/environment then run it.

Then run `runXxxTests.sh` to hit the `composed`, `inherited` or `inherited2` endpoints to see the behavior.

If shared controller functionality is pulled out and used via `composition` the transactions
will appear as expected.

If they are inherited, transaction naming mechanism will not work correctly.

PLEASE NOTE: If `inherited` endpoints are hit first directly after startup, it will potentially cause issues
with the `composed` endpoints as they cause problems with the internal workings of the New Relic Agent's
Spring controller annotation functionality.

## Desired functionality

Based on a root path from `@RestController("/childroot")` and an inherited parent method
annotated with `@GetMapping("/parentmethod")` (where 'Get' could be Post, Put or Delete) the transaction name
for GET requests to `.../childroot/parentmethod` would be `childroot/parentmethod (GET)`.

However, the instrumentation does not currently expect the inheritance of routes and deplays the route as
`<ChildControllerClassName>/<parentMethodName>`

![](undesired.png)

A quick workaround is to add `@RestController("/arbitraryrootpathforuniqueness")` to the parent controller.
This prevents causing disruptions with other endpoint transaction names in the instrumentation and gives
a transaction name that is closer to the desired one `parentmethod (GET)` that at least includes the path
specified in the parent controller AND the HTTP method used for the request.

![](workaround.png)

To fully achieve the desired transaction name and avoid unexpected results, the inheritance must be removed
and shared functionality used via composition.  This will achieve the most desirable results.

## Parent controller example with issue

Two `XxxChildController` classes inherit a root `GET` mapping in the `...inheritance` package.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/inherited/v1
curl http://localhost:8080/inherited/v2
```

This exhibits unfavorable behavior of transactions names that do not include HTTP method and
can negatively impact transaction names of the other endpoints.




## Workaround with annotated parent controller example

Same as above but the parent controller is annotated with `@RestController` and an arbitrary root pat is added.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/inherited2/v1
curl http://localhost:8080/inherited2/v2
```


## Controllers sharing functionality via composition

Two `Version#Controller` classes each have a root `GET` mapping in the `...composition` package.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/composed/v1
curl http://localhost:8080/composed/v2
```



The shared functionality has been refactored into a separate utility class `GetStuffAndDoThingsService`

## History

In early days of the Spring Framework the way you make a "controller" was to extend a Spring base controller class.

As this was found to be prohibitive and more designs increasingly chose to *Favor composition over inheritance* they began to use annotations.

*Favor composition over inheritance* is `Item 18` in Joshua Bloch's book *Effective Java, Third Edition*
